# Coding problems
Contains a range of programs such as Data structures, Algorithms, and other fundamental problems.

## Algorithmic patterns (based on my own experience)
### Arrays and Strings
- Always consider using Stacks and Queues to potentially achieve linear time complexity
- Using "count" and "max_count" variables help a lot
- Breaking the string with prefix (string[1:]), suffix (string[:n-1]), or in half can point toward recursive solutions
- Reverse the input string to use it against the original. (This is useful with common subsequence type problems)
